# BricksOpenLauncher
Android launcher app designed for use in car. Supports MirrorLink technology.

**This is open source version of CarBricks launcher, that could be found on [Google Play Market](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.evilcorp.brickslauncher)**

You can install BricksOpenLauncher on Android-powered head unit or use with your personal phone or tablet. The app also supports usage with Mirrorlink-enabled* car multimedia systems (limited support), so you can have access to all your favourite apps directly from a car head unit.

IMPORTANT! Currently, BricksOpenLauncher fully supports MirrorLink features for Sony and HTC devices only.

If you would like to use the app with Mirrorlink connection, consider precautions, as follows:
1)Your car has to have Mirrorlink support.
2)Your phone or tablet should also have built-in Mirrorlink support.
3)You can only use the app in parking mode, except the case your head unit activated to use any app anytime.
